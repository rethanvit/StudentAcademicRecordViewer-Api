Top 3:
1. Authentication/Authorization using JWT token
	- Allow the user only if he or she is in a role of Proctor/Admin
	- Allow proctor to view onl students he supervise/guide
	- Allow admin to view all students data
	- Unit testing coverage - 80%
	
2. Add a student
	- Allow adding student only after login



Nice to have:
1. Allow bulk import of students
2. Show the list of students the proctor/admin is assigned with on login
3. Allow student search using name/Id
4. Implement authentication/authorization using OAuth/OpenId
5. Seperate user and student DbContexts
6. Add a table which would contain program Id and it correspoding first AcademicCalendarDetailId and last AcademicCalendarDetailId(if program was stopped for some reason).
