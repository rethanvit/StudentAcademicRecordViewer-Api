Top 3:
1. Authentication/Authorization using JWT token
	- As an admin/proctor I should be able to login to the system.
	- As an admin, only I should be able to add a student
	- As an admin/proctor, I shoul dbe able to add courses to the student
2. Unit testing coverage - 70%


Nice to have:
1. Allow bulk import of students
2. Show the list of students the proctor/admin is assigned with on login
3. Allow student search using name/Id
4. Implement authentication/authorization using OAuth/OpenId
5. Seperate user and student DbContexts
6. Add a table which would contain program Id and it correspoding first AcademicCalendarDetailId and last AcademicCalendarDetailId(if program was stopped for some reason).
7. Allow proctor to view only students he supervise/guide
